# ⛔ WaniKani Locker

A simple Chrome extension that blocks access to websites **while you have pending WaniKani reviews**.

## ✍️ Description

This extension helps you stay on track with your Japanese learning by encouraging you to complete your WaniKani reviews before visiting time-wasting websites. When active:

- ❌ Blocks configured websites
- ⏸ Lets you pause the blocker for **10 minutes**
- ✅ Provides a quick link to **WaniKani Reviews**

> Requires a [WaniKani](https://www.wanikani.com) account with an API key. Only **read access** is needed.

## 🔍 Lessons Support (Partial)

There's code to support **WaniKani Lessons**, but currently no API endpoint/filter I could find provides a clean way to determine *only available lessons* (without returning all lessons in your level). If you discover the correct endpoint or filter, feel free to open an issue or pull request.

## 🔐 API Key Usage

You’ll need to provide your **WaniKani API key** via the extension popup.  
Your key is stored **locally** in your browser and used solely to check your review and lesson status.

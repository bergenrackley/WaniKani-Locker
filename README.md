Simple Chrome Extension that blocks access to websites while you have pending WaniKani Reviews.
Code exists for Lessons as well but I couldn't find the right endpoint that only showed active lessons you can take, rather than all the remaining ones for your current level. If you figure out the right filter/endpoint, please let me know and I'll update.
Requires WaniKani account w/ API access, just needs read access, no other permissions.

App either lets you pause the reminder for 10 minutes or go directly to WaniKani to complete your reviews.
